#### Stage3

- In the third stage we retrieve the data of the companies from the second stage and we basically clean the data from the second stage to remove stop words such as Full-time, part-time, contract etc. after cleaning the data we go into each company people section on linkedin and send a customized connection request to all the people working there with a note and your resume.

- Linkedin monitors the number of profiles you view and the amount of connection request you send.
- I strongly recommend you not to visit more than 1000 profiles and not send more than 100 connection request per week
- To prevent this i have have added a checker which will break the loop if you exceed the above limits
- In case of not obeying the caution, linkedin will send you a warning

### To-Do

- Create a web based interface

### I hope you lend to your dream company soon, keep patience and best of luck for the further process
